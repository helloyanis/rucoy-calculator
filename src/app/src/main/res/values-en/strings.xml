You can see it in the game's settings. If you have a buff (like 10+5) write the total amount here (15).\n- Weapon attack : The attack value of your training weapon. You can see it by clicking your weapon in the inventory.\n- Use Spiked Ring : If you have a spiked ring, it increases your chances of critical hits and makes you able to train on other monsters."</string>

    <string name="ptraintutorial_desc">"Power training is when you train by using your special attack to hit multiple mobs at a time. It can be faster to level up with power training, but costs a lot of mana and your defense won't follow the fast pace of power training, which means it will not upgrade the defense very much.\nOn this particular calculator, use the menu to pick your class. This is important because the magic special attack deals more damage than the others."</string>

You can gain time by dealing damage to monsters when you're playing, or by buying diamonds.\nYou can also get training dummies as items and it will automatically train your stat when you are away.\nIf you have multiple dummies in your inventory, the exp you will get will be split between stats, you don't get more stat points!"</string>
