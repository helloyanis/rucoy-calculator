# This application is no longer available on Google Play.

In short, I removed the app from the Google Play Store because Google requires you to reveal your personal info, like your full name, even for free and open source apps, which I think shouldn't apply for apps with no ads or without in-app purchases. The app is still available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.helloyanis.rucoycalculator/) (recommended) and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/helloyanis/rucoy-calculator/releases) (updates are not notified).

## How to install the app from F-Droid
1. Uninstall the app from Google Play Store if you have it installed.
2. Go to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.helloyanis.rucoycalculator/) and download F-Droid.
3. Install F-Droid by clicking on the .apk file and allowing unknown sources (this means allowing installing apps from outside Google Play) and open it.
4. Search for Rucoy Calculator and install it. You can also enable auto-update in F-Droid settings to get notified when a new version is available.
5. Enjoy the app!

## Can I still use the app?
Yes, the app is still available on F-Droid and GitHub releases. If you downloaded the app from Google Play, you can get it from there too but it won't be at the latest version, so it's recommended to use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.helloyanis.rucoycalculator/). The app will continue to work indefinitely as it's made to work offline.

## Is F-Droid safe?
Yes, F-Droid is a trusted open source app store. The F-Droid team has built the app themselves from the source code available publicly on this GitHub repository. You can check the source code and the build process on their website. F-Droid is a great alternative to Google Play Store for open source apps and it's way more developer-friendly. You can also check the [F-Droid FAQ](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ/) for more information about how it works.

## Do I need to keep F-Droid installed after getting Rucoy Calculator from it?
Yes, if you would like to install future updates automatically! If you don't care about updates you can uninstall it, but it's best to keep it there to get the latest features!

## Why was the app removed from Google Play Store?
The app was removed from Google Play Store because Google requires you to reveal your personal info, like your full name, even for free and open source apps. I don't want to publicly share my full name, so I decided to remove the app from Google Play Store. 

## I still see the app in the play store, why?
It can be for a few reasons:
- You already downloaded the app from Google Play Store so it's been permanently added to your Google Account.
- Google takes some time to unpublish the app for everyone, so it may take a few days to be removed from the store.
- Someone rebuilt the app and published it on their own developer account. Be careful with this, as it may contain malware or ads. Always download apps from trusted sources like F-Droid!
